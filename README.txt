DS Direct Messaging Application


Functionality:

The DS Direct Messaging Application allows users to send and
receive direct messages to other users on the DSP platform.
It incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter,
making it easy for users to communicate with their peers.
The application follows a protocol for sending and receiving
messages, ensuring seamless communication.


Features:

Direct Messaging Protocol Implementation: The application
implements the direct messaging protocol, allowing users
to send messages to specific recipients on the DSP platform.
Users can also request to retrieve all messages or only new
messages from the server.

DS Direct Messenger Module: The ds_messenger.py module
facilitates message sending and retrieval. It includes methods
for sending messages, retrieving new messages, and retrieving
all messages from the server.

Local Message Storage: The application stores message data
locally, eliminating the need to reconnect to the DSP server
to view previous messages. Recipient data is also stored
locally, reducing the need for users to re-add contacts each
time they use the program.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The GUI provides an intuitive
interface for users to interact with the application.
It includes features such as displaying messages from different
users, sending messages, adding new contacts, and retrieving new
messages automatically.
